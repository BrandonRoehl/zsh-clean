# zsh-clean
![Showcase](_README/img.png?raw=true)

A [pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) varient however.

Clean is not pure and pure is not clean

## Goals

Pure's main goal is to produce a really minimalistic setup and nothing
in the prompt.

While as in clean's main goal is to produce a clean code base with no
dependencies as well as supporting tons of customization.

So customizing the prompt to be supper crazy and over the top complicated
Or be a single line

## Differences

| Pure | Clean |
|------|-------|
| Requires Dependencies | Doesn't |
| Isn't customizable | Can completly replace the prompt |
| Custom methods for vcs | Uses `vcs_info` hooks |
| Doesn't show breakdown of vcs | Shows the breakdown like most other git prompts |
| Only works with git | Works with `git` `hg` `svn` and all others that `vcs_info` supports |
